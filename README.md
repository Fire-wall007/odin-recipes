This project is to demonstrate the basic HTML knowledge I've learned so far with The Odin Project.
Some of the techniques I will be applying are
  1. Establishing boilerplate
  2. Using HTML heading, tags, and element
  3. Style text using elements such as strong and em
  4. Creating ordered and unordered lists
  5. Inserting images and links
